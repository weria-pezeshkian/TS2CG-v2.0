# TS2CG version 1.2

TS2CG converts triangulated surfaces (TS) to coarse-grained membrane models for molecular
simulation.
It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or
to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

## State

**NOTE**: this version is under development and might be associated with errors and bugs.
Please consider using the previous version if you are not in direct contact with the developers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes three separate scripts. *Pointillism* (PLM) and *Membrane
Builder* (PCG) and *Solvate* (SOL).

The minimum installation requirements are:
- Up-to-date *C++ compilers*.
- *Python* 3.6 or later.
- *CMake* version 3.10 or later.

TS2CG builds with the CMake build system, requiring at least version 3.10. You can check whether
CMake is installed, and what version it is, with

```console
cmake --version
```

If you need to install CMake, then first check whether your platformâ€™s package management system
provides a suitable version, or visit the [CMake installation](https://cmake.org/resources/) page
for pre-compiled binaries, source code and installation instructions.
